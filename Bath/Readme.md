## Augmented Reality

We used:
* Weird Type (paid app) - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weird-type/id1352785248
* Unfolding Shrines - https://www.shapearts.org.uk/unfolding-shrines

For video capture of movement we used a GoPro 8 duct-taped to the lower front wheel suport.

## Physical marking 

We used:
* Water
* Chalk
* Water & Chalk
* Ripping paper.

## GPS Trails

Mobile applications for creating GPS trails. Works best under an open sky. 

Hit record, Move around, Stop record, Share in any format (screenshots or exporting route files in any format).

* Apple - MyTracks https://www.mytracks4mac.info/en/#hero

Under record/settings there are a few options that improve recording:
- Turn off "Record in motion only" (stopping is part of drawing)
- Turn off "Smooth recording" (more noisy routes but better accuracy of motion).
- Time Interval: 1sec

* Android - GPSLogger https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.basicairdata.graziano.gpslogger

If there is trouble with the Android app there are a list if alternatives: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android#Track_recording

Also works with fitness tracking apps like Strava (https://www.strava.com).
